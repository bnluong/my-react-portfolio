## Motivation

After getting my feet wet with web development using React JS, I wanted to make
my own porfolio website from scratch. So here we are. This repo is to show case
how I built my porfolio. You're free to clone and examine the code but
modification and redistribution are not allowed.

## Getting Started

#### Getting the Source Code

```
git clone https://github.com/bnluong/my-react-portfolio.git
```

#### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

`npm install`

-   Install all dependencies.<br />

`npm start`

-   Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
-   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the
    browser.

## Built With

###### Frameworks

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - React framework
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

    Note: API call uses my private api keys setup. You should use your own api keys for these APIs. Set them up in the .env file and change the variable names accordingly.
    ```
