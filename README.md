## Motivation

After getting my feet wet with web development using React JS, I wanted to make
my own porfolio website from scratch. So here we are. This repo is to show case
how I built my porfolio. You're free to clone and examine the code but
modification and redistribution are not allowed.

## Getting Started

#### Prerequisite

Latest version of nodejs and npm

#### Getting the Source Code

```
git clone https://github.com/bnluong/my-react-portfolio.git
```

#### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

`npm install`

-   Install all dependencies.<br />

`npm start`

-   Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
-   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the
    browser.
